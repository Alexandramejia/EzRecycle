ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- Use the detailed material information to provide precise recycling guidance
- Consider the item's condition when recommending disposal methods
- If multiple materials are present, address each one specifically
- Factor in size and quantity for practical disposal advice
- Address any special features or concerns mentioned
- Provide location-specific guidance when possible
- Be extremely specific about preparation steps
- Include safety warnings for any hazardous materials
- Prioritize environmental impact and proper disposal
- Consider the full lifecycle of the item

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- If the item contains mixed materials, provide guidance for each component
- If recycling codes are mentioned, use them to provide specific plastic recycling guidance
- Consider contamination issues based on the item's condition
- Provide alternatives when recycling isn't the best option
- Be educational about why certain disposal methods are recommended
